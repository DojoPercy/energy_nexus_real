## Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. **Recommendation Queries** (`src/sanity/lib/recommendation-queries.ts`)
```typescript
// Sophisticated GROQ queries that implement the recommendation algorithm
export const getSmartRecommendations = `
  // Multi-strategy recommendation query combining:
  // - Related by taxonomy (sectors, regions, tags)
  // - Trending content (recent + featured)
  // - Diverse content types
  // - Related publications and events
`;
```

#### 2. **Content Recommendations Component** (`src/components/ContentRecommendations.tsx`)
- Displays smart suggestions in a clean, engaging layout
- Handles different content types (articles, interviews, videos, events)
- Includes analytics tracking for each recommendation click
- Responsive design with hover effects and smooth transitions

#### 3. **Related Content Component** (`src/components/RelatedContent.tsx`)
- Shows content related by taxonomy, author, or organization
- Organized in sections for better user understanding
- Grid layout optimized for different screen sizes
- Enhanced analytics with taxonomy matching details

#### 4. **Analytics System** (`src/lib/analytics.ts`)
- Comprehensive tracking of user interactions
- Google Analytics 4 integration
- Content engagement metrics
- Recommendation performance analysis

#### 5. **Content Engagement Hook** (`src/hooks/useContentEngagement.ts`)
- Tracks time spent on content
- Monitors scroll depth
- Detects user inactivity
- Measures content engagement patterns

## Implementation

### Recommendation Algorithm

The system uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **Taxonomy Matches** (Weighted scoring):
   - Sectors: 3 points per match
   - Regions: 2 points per match
   - Tags: 1 point per match

2. **Content Quality**:
   - Featured content: +2 points
   - Recent content (90 days): +1 point
   - Very recent content (7 days): +1 point

3. **Content Type Diversity**:
   - Ensures variety in recommendations
   - Prevents content type clustering
   - Balances different content formats

### Content Types Supported

- **Articles**: News articles and analysis pieces
- **Interviews**: Executive interviews and Q&As
- **Videos**: Video content and multimedia
- **Events**: Conferences, webinars, and meetings
- **Special Reports**: In-depth research and analysis
- **Publications**: Issues and magazines

### Integration Points

The recommendation system is integrated into:

1. **Article Pages** (`src/app/articles/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Smart recommendations section
   - Related content by taxonomy and author
   - Engagement tracking

2. **Interview Pages** (`src/app/interviews/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Cross-content type recommendations
   - Organization-based suggestions
   - Interview-specific analytics

3. **Publication Pages** (`src/app/publications/[slug]/page.tsx`)
   - Related publications by sector/region
   - Content from the same year
   - Publication-specific engagement metrics

## Analytics & Metrics

### Tracked Events

1. **Recommendation Views**
   - Current content ID and type
   - Number of recommendations shown
   - Types of content recommended

2. **Recommendation Clicks**
   - Clicked content details
   - Recommendation source (smart suggestions, related content, etc.)
   - Taxonomy matches between current and recommended content
   - Position of clicked recommendation

3. **Content Engagement**
   - Time spent on content
   - Scroll depth (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
   - User inactivity detection
   - Content view and exit events

4. **User Behavior**
   - Search queries and results
   - Filter usage patterns
   - Content preferences
   - Conversion events

### Performance Metrics

- **Click-through Rate (CTR)**: Percentage of recommendations clicked
- **Engagement Rate**: Time spent and scroll depth
- **Conversion Rate**: Actions taken after viewing recommendations
- **Content Discovery**: New content found through recommendations

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

```env
# Google Analytics 4
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX

# Sanity Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
```

### Customization Options

1. **Recommendation Limits**
   ```typescript
   <ContentRecommendations
     maxItems={6}  // Number of recommendations to show
     title="You Might Also Like"  // Custom title
   />
   ```

2. **Analytics Settings**
   ```typescript
   // Enable/disable specific tracking
   useContentEngagement({
     contentId: 'content_id',
     contentType: 'article',
     enabled: true  // Toggle engagement tracking
   });
   ```

3. **Recommendation Sources**
   ```typescript
   // Configure which recommendation strategies to use
   const recommendationSources = [
     'relatedByTaxonomy',
     'trending',
     'diverseTypes',
     'publications',
     'events'
   ];
   ```
